2021 Virtual Campfire:

With school being virtual during the 2020-2021 school year, there is no paper to burn, only word docs, pdfs, etc.
So I made this program to "burn" all these files

How To Use:

1. drag and drop the files you want to "burn" into the window
2. the fire will light up proportonal to the size of the file and then be deleted when the fire goes out
3. remember to make copies of any of the files you want to keep, as they cannot be recovered once deleted, they will not even go into the recycling bin
4. DO NOT move, rename, or modify the mov files or the program will not work (they can be moved, as long as they stay in the same folder as the python file)
5. please DO NOT try to "burn" more than one file at a time, or try to "burn" one before the previous file has finished or it may glitch out the program
6. by running this program you agree to the terms that the creator of this program is not responsible for the accidental deleting of any files
